## What This Tool Does

This notebook transforms lengthy interview transcripts into **semantically coherent chunks**—meaningful segments that respect natural conversation boundaries while preserving speaker identity and turn-taking patterns. Rather than facing a 50-page interview transcript as one overwhelming document, you receive coherent segments, each labeled and sized for systematic qualitative coding.

## Key Features

1. **Multi-Format Support**: Works with common transcript formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT, RTF)
2. **Ethnographically-Aware Chunking**: Preserves speaker labels (Q:, A:, Interviewer:, etc.) and conversation structure
3. **Intelligent Segmentation**: Uses AI to identify natural topic boundaries rather than arbitrary text splits
4. **Two Analysis Methods**:
   - **Claude API**: More sophisticated understanding of conversational flow
   - **Sentence Transformers**: No API required, good for privacy-sensitive research
5. **Flexible Configuration**: Adjust chunk sizes and sensitivity to match your analytical needs
6. **Multiple Export Formats**: CSV, Excel, JSON - structured for use with NVivo, ATLAS.ti, and other analysis tools
7. **Quality Metrics**: Built-in validation to ensure text preservation and chunking quality

## Workflow

1. **Configure Parameters**: Set chunking sensitivity and size preferences using intuitive controls
2. **Upload Transcripts**: Batch process multiple interview files
3. **AI-Powered Segmentation**: Automatic identification of topic boundaries and speaker turns
4. **Quality Review**: Statistical analysis of chunking results with visualizations
5. **Export for Analysis**: Download structured data ready for qualitative coding software

## Applications in Anthropological Practice

This tool supports any research involving interview transcripts—from dissertation fieldwork to applied research projects. It's particularly useful for computational analysis using the tools in my AI Anthropology Toolkit and comparative studies requiring standardized data units and collaborative research where multiple team members need consistent data preparation.

## Methodological Positioning

This tool represents a **computational anthropology** approach—using AI to enhance rather than replace traditional ethnographic analysis. The chunking preserves the interpretive work that defines anthropological inquiry while addressing the practical challenges of scale in contemporary research contexts.

**Important**: This tool prepares data for analysis but does not interpret it.

## Target Audience

Designed for anthropologists and qualitative researchers working with interview data—from graduate students managing thesis interviews to research teams processing large datasets for applied projects.

## Technical Approach

The system employs **semantic similarity analysis** to identify topical coherence in conversation. Rather than splitting text arbitrarily, it analyzes meaning relationships between sentences to find natural break points where topics shift or new themes emerge. This preserves the conversational integrity essential for anthropological interpretation.

## Contributing to AI Anthropology

This notebook contributes to the emerging field of AI Anthropology—which combines studying AI as cultural artifact, using AI to enhance ethnographic research, and applying anthropological insights to AI development (Artz, forthcoming). By open-sourcing these tools, this work advances the collective capacity of anthropologists to work effectively with computational methods.

## AI Anthropology Toolkit

This tool is part of a growing suite of computational resources for anthropological research:

- **[Qualitative Codebook Builder](https://github.com/MattArtzAnthro/Qualitative_Codebook_Builder)** - AI-assisted development of qualitative coding frameworks
- **[Interview Transcript Semantic Chunker](https://github.com/MattArtzAnthro/Interview_Transcript_Semantic_Chunker)** (this tool) - AI-assisted segmentation of interview transcripts
- **[Coding and Thematic Analysis](https://github.com/MattArtzAnthro/Coding_and_Thematic_Analysis)** - AI-assisted coding and thematic analysis of qualtiative data

*Additional tools will be added to this toolkit as they are developed.*
